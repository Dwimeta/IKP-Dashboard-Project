# IKP Dashboard Project (Food Security Index â€“ Indonesia)

This repository contains my project on creating an **Interactive Dashboard** for the Indonesian **Food Security Index (IKP)** using Microsoft Excel.
The project was created as part of my data analysis learning journey and portfolio building.
